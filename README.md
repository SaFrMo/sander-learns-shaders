## Introduction
I've been wanting to write GLSL shaders since I first saw websites like [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), but I could never find an approachable guide until stumbling across [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).

This repo isn't going to be a guide like The Book of Shaders is, but rather a set of snapshots of me working through the tutorials on that site. I'm hoping to document my thought process and experience learning GLSL to help any other beginners along the way!

### Organization
I'll keep my starting point in the top level of the repo at `base.glsl`. Any interesting and unexpected I come across will be in the `happy-accidents`, and the rest of the directories will reference specific entries.

I'm writing this code in [Atom](https://atom.io/) using the `glsl-preview` and `language-glsl` packages for code highlighting and previewing results.

## First Steps
Coming soon!
